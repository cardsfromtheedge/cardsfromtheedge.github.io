Many weeks have passed, since I wrote the last blog. 

In fact, I had contemplated stopping completely, nothing had been forth coming, and again I questioned the purpose of it… but then suddenly tonight, I felt like writing!

I’ve just come indoors, the sea is calm and after a few days of low cloud, and occasional heavy rain showers, the sun has joined us again ☺

I know it’s there all the time, but some days it just does not feel like it. Especially as I knew the rest of the country seemed to be basking in full sunshine.

So, this a “knitting together” of two moments in time, when it truly felt like heaven on earth. A few weeks ago and then, fast forward to this delightful evening.

Whilst out skiing one day, near the end of the season, I had a huge wave of gratitude sweep over me.

I was on a deserted ski slope among the trees, the sun had come out for a few glorious moments, and I stood for a while in solitude, face to the sunshine soaking up the late afternoon rays.

I felt an over whelming sense of the magic that is all around us.

So grateful for the love of skiing, the warm clothes I was wearing (it’s been a cold winter!), the peacefulness of the mountain, the perfect snow conditions that we’ve had almost the whole season, the fresh mountain air, the stunning view across the valley, and the freedom of being on the mountain.

And last but not least, the lovely company of friends for a hot chocolate stop and an unplanned lunch stop too. Heaven on earth ☺

But then, everything felt so overwhelming in that moment too.

It was a truly magical moment because it was as though all my dreams had come true. Often however, in these moments of magic, my heart goes out to the people I have lost, so I pause a minute longer to remember them all, and to send love out to the ones still suffering.

I have always been a thinker. Some might say, I think too much…

This whole thing, of life after loss doesn’t go away though, as I’ve said before, you live along side it. Life will have many more happy moments, but it just feels like it is never quite the same again.

I find myself searching for answers about things I’d never really questioned before.

The previous night was a good example, when I found myself, in between other blogs, reading an introduction to a book about Mediums. 

I love the fact, that so many books have made their first chapter available on line, so you can try before you buy.  My list of books to buy is getting ever longer… ☺

I have never had, what I would call a mystical experience, but I have a sense of something greater than us being all around, if you take some time out to quietly absorb your surroundings I’m sure you’ll feel it too.

I am open to anything that offers an explanation to the unexplainable!

And my offering now, is that Heaven is a place on Earth…

Why oh why, can I now hear Belinda Carlisle’s song in my head ☺

One book I read a few years ago, which gives an explanation to this contemplation is “WHAT IF *THIS* IS HEAVEN? By Anita Moorjani.

I came across Anita Moorjani when her first book (Dying to be Me) was recommended to us, on Dr. David R. Hamilton Phd’s Integrating Science Seminar, back in 2014.

I was so fascinated by her story, that when I saw she was holding a one day workshop in London a couple of years later, I jumped at the chance to attend, flying back from France to be there! 

The whole day was inspirational and there was a double bonus, as her guest speaker was David, and I also met up with some of the other lovely attendees from David’s seminar. It is such a memorable day.

In fact, it’s making me think I’d like to read the books again.

And breathe! 

I’m back from my trip down memory lane…

So tonight, there I was, armed with my favourite beach towel and a cushion, venturing out onto the bench that is positioned perfectly to take in the last rays of sunshine. 

The sun, at this time of year goes down behind the mountains, and I wrapped the beach towel around me to keep warm. There is still the odd patch of snow clinging to the gullies. The sea is calm, and the swallows have arrived after their incredible journey. 

I hear a cuckoo, and watch as tiny ripples come into shore. 

A few clouds are moving across the sky, I marvel at the simple joy of sitting outside in the evening for the 1st time this summer. It may only be for 10 minutes, but again I know this is indeed Heaven on Earth… ☺

With gratitude for your patience, and here’s hoping you find your own heaven on earth, wherever you are, and whatever you are doing, no matter what you are going through. With love X
