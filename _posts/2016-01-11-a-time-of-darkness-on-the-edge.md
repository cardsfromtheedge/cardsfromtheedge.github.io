Sometimes it’s good, not knowing what’s around the corner!

I say this as I sit awake at 3am wondering why I’m awake, and knowing there’s only one thing to do! This happens occasionally, and the best thing to do for me, is to write, whether it be emails, poems or now blogs. What do you do when you *can’t* sleep? That’s made me smile ☺ as one of the mantras I’ve carried with me since I was 10 years old is – *there’s no such thing as can’t*…

My wonderful primary school Headmaster taught me that. He would regularly say ‘there’s no such thing as *can’t* do that” followed by – “only words like don’t want to, won’t, don’t feel like it apply”. It’s true, it’s not that I *can’t* sleep, it’s that I don’t feel like sleep. Through the years, this has helped me remember that anything is possible and for me, there really is no such word as can’t! Try it out for size yourself and see how it feels when applied to your world. It may not move mountains, but it may help you focus on the top ☺

When I decided to write **Cards from the Edge**, it never entered my head to think I can’t do this. I just took it day-by-day, going with the flow and slowly everything started falling into place. I may not have gone about it in a conventional or necessarily logical order, but it has worked for me. Some days have flowed better than others, and I have had to remind myself in the last few weeks to have faith and let go.

This has been liberating to say the least, with a family illness to attend to, life on the Edge has become very much a day-by-day affair. I have been constantly reminding myself, there is no such word as can’t and that when I do let go, trust and have faith, hypothetical mountains do indeed start to move. Learning to trust has been a big part of this process of letting go. I have more success on some days than others, but my daily meditation practice helps me to remain calm, and in the present moment as often as possible.

*What do you do to keep yourself in the here and now?* When I focus on the present moment, I feel the weight dropping away from me as I no longer waste energy on worrying about what has already happened and don’t expend as much energy projecting uncontrollable “what if’s” into the future. What a great time and energy saver, both incredibly valuable, in times of stress and difficulty.

There is a beautiful peacefulness that descends in the middle of the night, I love the opportunity to reflect and write in these moments. I hope this blog brings peace to you in this busy and often stressful world. Remind yourself to be present in the *here* and *now*, remember to take time out for *you*, and to feel present as often as possible and finally breathe! Ah yes, another personal reminder ☺
