Whilst writing *the* cards from the edge, life was often all about breathing. I remember needing to let my friend know that I was alongside her as she journeyed onwards. I remember coming across this poem I’d written a few years earlier and it felt a good way to share an understanding with her. Here’s the beginning of the poem (full version in the book):- 

STOP
One day at a time, 
One hour in that day,
Stop and BREATHE
AND breathe, breathe,
In and out,
In and out.
JoT

So, fast-forward 3 years, and life again is all about breathing. I guess in between that, life has been all about breathing too, but it’s something we so easily take for granted. *Take a moment to really feel your breath, breathe in, and breathe out. Simple.* We do it automatically and rarely stop to think, am I breathing? Because, we know we are, but tonight I’m feeling grateful for the ability to breathe easily, as I spend my days caring for, and watching someone again struggling to breathe sometimes. I remind them to breathe in through their nose and out through their mouth, and as I do that myself I place my hand on my belly, to ensure I’ve not slipped into shallow breathing again myself.  It’s such a basic thing, yet imperative for life and living.

I smile to myself as I write this, because I’m humbled every time I’m brought back to the *Here* and *Now*.  It’s so easy to get bogged down with what’s going on around you, and time and again I find myself remembering simple tools that help me cope with whatever is happening. Back to breathing; back to being in the present moment; and although, never having had any mindfulness training I find myself, *mindfully* going about simple daily tasks putting my heart and soul into them. So that when the end of the day arrives, I feel grateful for small blessings and can sleep well, knowing it’s been a good day.

And it has been a good day… my sock-shopping trip was successful! I made the time to meditate for 20 minutes, and I got a great review on Amazon for the book (this made my day). The cauliflower cheese I made for the 1st time in years was delicious (even if I do say so myself), the homemade chicken soup was a hit, and the delicious coffee sponge cake made by a wonderful neighbour was enjoyed by all. OK, so today was mainly about food, but it made all the breathing worthwhile ☺

And so, as I get to the bottom of the page, I smile yet again as I realise I’m feeding myself my own medicine! I’ve meditated today, I’ve just listed the good bits of today, so I’m feeling grateful, and I even managed to take a deep breath or two as I put the bins out tonight. All, while the moon beamed brightly down upon the world in all her glory.  Yes, today has been a
