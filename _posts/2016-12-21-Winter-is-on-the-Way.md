What beautiful Autumnal days we have seen recently, the colours are stunning, and we are seeing plenty of rainbows here in the Highlands. It is with a sense of awe that I look out on the scenery and marvel at Nature’s bounty and magnificence. The mountaintops are dusted in white, as the first snow arrived last week, and it makes for some stunning photography. I love the changing seasons and this time of year is no exception. Even when the rain is lashing down and the waves are crashing onto the beach, there is a power greater than us all and it fascinates me.

Today has been a calm day on the sea, albeit a bit dull and grey with low clouds, but I made the effort to go down to the beach this morning searching for some clarity. After reading a post on Facebook from Hay House, about what to do on this super moon day, I decided to follow some of the instructions, about forgiveness and gratitude. I took pen, paper and some matches with me, as I headed down to the sea! Before I got to the beach I stopped by the fire pit and wrote a list of people I felt I needed to forgive and I started with myself. I then burnt the post-its one by one, letting go as I did so. Such a simple act, and yet it helped me yet again move on. I felt like my sister doing this, she loved fire. I even had her on my list, for leaving us too soon, although I had forgiven her immediately because I always did. As I write this, I know it is time to say that she took her own life and that is a big thing to come to terms with. Any loss is difficult, but some greater than others.

Afterwards, as I sat imagining that I could see the super moon that everyone is talking about at the moment, I felt a peacefulness sweep over me.  Even though I knew I’d not see the moon tonight, or so the forecast said, it was enchanting to know she was there behind the clouds.  I contemplated forgiveness in general, and yet again have been reminded that to forgive is so liberating, especially for your own well-being, it is not about any wrong doing being OK, but it does allow you to feel at peace with life’s events. 

I felt at peace for the first time today, while sitting on that rock looking out to sea. I’m not unhappy, but there were things to do, decisions to make and all I needed was some space to be. Sitting staring out to sea works a treat, and I count my blessings for having easy access to the sea. Time and again, I go into Nature to clear my head and get some clarity on whatever is troubling me. Even if I don’t get the answer straight away, something shifts and helps me move forward again. With forgiveness and always gratitude for reading this far! ☺
