It’s surprising feeling the need to write about my current experience. I’m sat looking out to sea, but my world has changed. Nothing major has happened outwardly, but inwardly my world has changed forever. 

As yet, unsure of the outcome, I’ll do my very best to improve my chances of success! I’ll let you into a secret - I’ve had a tooth extracted today and I’m feeling numb right now, but I’m also feeling relieved. 

My inner world has been limping along for a long time and I’m now beginning to realize how much we put up with, before we’re ready to take action.

It got me thinking - this is how we often cope with things in our outer life.  We put up with things that make us sad, resentful, or angry, holding on for far too long. And yet within a flash we can let go of whatever it is that is bothering us, and start afresh with new actions and new thoughts. 

It is a timely reminder that our thoughts are so powerful. 

As we drove through the glen and over the hills to get to the Dentist, I was constantly repeating self-made mantras in my head to assure myself that all was well. 

It didn’t matter if I truly believed them in that moment, the power was in the message that I was sending to myself and the result was a meditative state (please note I was not driving!) that stopped the unhelpful thoughts of what could go wrong.

It must have worked because the extraction was a smooth and clean one and, although I’m sat here feeling a bit sorry for myself, I’m also in awe at the power of my thoughts to help something, that I had been dreading, go very well.

In times of stress it is so easy to spiral into unhelpful thoughts that can and will potentially make a situation worse. 

Over the years I can now see objectively, when I’ve not helped myself have a better outcome. Have you been in a similar situation yourself? Maybe your thoughts have taken control and you have worried more than was necessary. 

I’m sure we’ve all experienced that at one time or another. Remember (as I often tell myself!) to be kind to yourself, remember your body and mind are connected and as you think, so you steer your body towards peace or stress. I know which one I prefer… ☺

One of the books I’ve read recently, (twice in fact, it has so much wisdom in it) is called Happiness Millionaire by Janet Jones - <a href="http://www.happinessmillionaire.com/">http://www.happinessmillionaire.com/</a> and something I remember, is Janet talking about helpful and unhelpful thoughts.

It really resonated with me, I now ask myself the simple question “is this thought helpful?” If it is not, I reframe it and ensure the next thought is a helpful one. If I struggle doing this, I move into mantra/affirmation mode. 

It forces the mind away from the unhelpful thoughts and in time, the results can be dramatic to say the least. 

When I first started using these methods years ago, I did not have a lot of faith in my own abilities to ‘rewire my brain’ as I once declared I wanted to do.  However, over the years, I have seen so many times how I have helped myself move into a better place inwardly and that in turn has improved my outer world no end.
If this concept is new to you, there are many books out there to help you get started and open new doors. In my next post I’ll make some suggestions to help you along the way. 

In the meantime, the numbness is wearing off and I’m back to looking out to sea and possibly resting my eyes for a while too. 

May your thoughts be helpful ones… With gratitude and love. ☺
