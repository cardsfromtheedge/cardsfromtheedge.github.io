I’ve been thinking about my next blog post for several weeks now. Nothing has been forthcoming, while I’ve enjoyed the creativity that has flowed elsewhere – namely, making new Cards from the Edge.

It has been great fun, and has taken me down memory lane looking for photos that make me smile or bring a happy memory that would make the basis for another card.

It was the same well over 5 years ago, when the original cards were made. Always searching my photos, looking for inspiration and connection.

Now I’m beginning to appreciate the limitations of the many photos taken with a smartphone.  When enlarged they often do not work and, sometimes a photo that I love just doesn’t look at home on a card.

The last month or so, while spending several hours searching through photos, has made me come to a realization, that I may need to dig out a proper camera and more terrifyingly learn how to use it properly. 

You see, I love taking photos, and have done so all my life, but I’ve always shied away from the technicalities of ‘proper cameras’… it always seems somewhat confusing.

Besides, what’s the automatic button for? If not for taking said photos ☺

I’ve had an SLR for as long as I can remember, but as soon as digital came out I bought a small digital camera and didn’t really look back. Then of course smartphones got better and better cameras on them.

Every time I thought of taking my SLR out with me, I’d often decide against it, due to the weight involved, and now of course with my digital SLR there are extra lenses too.

I’m beginning to smile at myself (always a good sign) at the list of excuses that are piling up as I write. 

The bottom line is, I would like to take better quality photos if I’m going to continue making Cards from the Edge. There, I’ve said it - it’s out there. No turning back, make it happen….

Now - fast forward several more weeks, and still no blog has been published, until today. 

I could list many reasons, but what springs to mind tonight, as I realise how long ago my last post was, and I attempt to complete this blog for you, it doesn’t matter what the reason is, as I’m laughing at myself as I ponder, whether I scared myself silly about the camera observations above?

Quite possibly, and for several weeks the blog was left hanging, waiting for action. 

Action may be taken in due course as regards photography, but in an attempt to re-connect with you, this is my offering to complete this blog. It felt better than starting another new blog. 

Many weeks have passed since no.28 (the last one) of the new batch of ‘Cards from the Edge’ was published. They are Facebook if you’d like to read some of them.

I had so much fun doing them, and yet instead of firing up my blog writing creativity, it seemed to stall it. I again had to remind myself, that it would return when the time was right.

And it has, feeling so grateful tonight as I type away.

In the meantime, I have been reading other blog posts, and tonight after reading several from my wonderful friend Bernie at The Barefoot Sanctuary, something really resonated with me. 

Taking ACTION….read Bernie’s post here -

Suddenly, I felt compelled to take action! I have been very conscious that I’ve not written in a while. And now I can see that more blog posts would not appear without taking some action!

*Have you been thinking about something recently that needs action?*

One of the lessons of recent years is learning to feel my way through life. 

This sometimes means that no action is taken at all, especially if nothing feels right. It is a good way to know if something is meant for you.

I spent years, often making decisions from my head. Nowadays, more and more, I endeavour to make decisions from my heart, because it simply feels better. 

Place your hand on your heart and ask the question you have in mind. How does it feel when you have an answer?  If it feels good, it’s the right thing to do, if it does not feel so good, maybe doing nothing is the best course of action…

I’m still learning, but I know while writing this blog, it feels good ☺

Time is moving on, and Spring is just around the corner, and yet, tonight as more snow silently fell, it did not feel that way. This winter has just kept on giving!

But, as the days lengthen, and the warmth from the sun hopefully returns to fill our days, may you receive your own helpful insights by feeling your way through life. 

As always with gratitude for the moments of clarity we see, in this sometimes, muddled world, and for knowing when to take action ☺
