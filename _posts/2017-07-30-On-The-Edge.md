For many days, I’ve been pondering getting back on track, getting out into nature more and making some time to create. Since the last blog, there has been very little creativity and even a few blocked pathways! However, to get back on track, I find myself sat down in an attempt to move forward again! Re-reading that, it seems rather muddled, but in all honesty expresses where I’m at, right now. ☺

Life has been pretty hectic over the last couple of months. However, there is a yearning to simplify even more, so for the next month an intention has been set to stay closer to home and focus on things that need attention, and where possible, things that continue to make my heart sing. And right now, that’s what I need. *What do you need right now?* Please take a few moments to consider this question. There is always a great desire to be a ‘Human Doing’ when summer arrives, rather than a Human Being! Just ‘being’ often form the important bits between the ‘doing’, so that creativity has a chance to flow. Back to meditation or staring out to sea! And remember to breathe too.

Although, all the visiting and doing bits are very enjoyable, I often then realize, that we’re past mid-summer and before we know it, it’ll be snowing again and what I really need to do, is tick off some of the items on the ‘other’ to do list…

I pause, having written that, as I do not have another to do list yet! But, in my heart I know there are things that need to be completed before another year passes. That’s when I again realize, it’s all about priorities, and what’s important to me may not be important to the next person.  That’s the great thing about life, we all have different priorities and potentially a different perspective on what needs doing.  So, we can make the rules up as we go along, we can make general plans and we may well have a schedule to work around, but we are (thankfully) free to make the rest up as we go along. I sit back in my chair, and a huge wave of gratitude sweeps over me as I acknowledge how my life has brought me to this peaceful place.

I’m sat in my friends shop, looking after it for the day, so that she can complete some of her priorities. I love this place, it has been a quieter day than expected, but I’ve met some lovely folk who are on holiday. A couple of visitors have been remembering Jenny (as in Cards from the Edge) and that brings back happy memories for me. A small purple, heather inspired dream-catcher has been finished, and FINALLY I’ve started writing again. I really was beginning to think it had gone for good. I was shocked to see the date of my last blog post, and immediately started to type in the hope of further creative inspiration. I am surrounded by the inspirations of other creative people and rejoice in these treasures as I write.

*Where do you get your inspiration, to start a new project, maybe finish an old one, or even just see things from a new perspective?*  For me, one of my favourite places has to be the beach (second only to the mountains of course).  So much comes from walking on a beach, especially if you are able to walk barefoot. It’s possible to spend hours, shell searching on a sandy beach, and the last week has seen me paddling on the shore once again. Onwards and upwards, feeling grateful as I go…☺
