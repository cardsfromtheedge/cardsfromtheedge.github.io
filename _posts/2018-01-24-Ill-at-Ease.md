The last week has been challenging on many levels. While a cold has kept me physically low, others events have had a major impact too. It’s been a matter of literally, mind over matter trying to keep moving forward.

I decided at the onset of the cold to take it easy and allow my body the time it would need to heal. I rested, made hot toddies (minus the whisky) and read and looked out on the rain that persisted in falling after all the heavy snow we had had the previous week.

The anxiety mentioned in the previous blog had subsided, and in fact as I sit typing now, I feel strangely liberated from a couple of weeks of mental angst. It really feels as though all is well in the world at this precise moment.

It’s very early in the morning and I’ve been awake for a couple of hours already. Lying in bed trying to sleep, was not resulting in sleep, and there was an over whelming urge to get up and start writing.

That’s when the magic happened!

The moment I followed my heart and crept out of bed, turned the heaters on, switched the kettle on for a hot drink and settled myself down to write, everything fell into place again.

Nothing momentous has happened, and yet everything has happened.

The tightness in my stomach has gone, and the treadmill thoughts in my head have subsided. I’ve stopped coughing and I’m seeing a way forward again. This time not literally, but I feel it in my bones for want of a better expression.

As time moves on, I recognize all these feelings and know they will pass. However, when you are in the middle of any type of angst, it can feel overwhelming as though it will go on forever. 

It will not. It too shall pass.

To put this all into context, there have been more bereavements and a family illness to attend to. It doesn’t matter how many deaths you are faced with, whether it is a person you are close to, or someone you have not met, but have a connection to (remember we are all connected) or a family pet, or a friends pet, they all have an impact on you. Some of course, are greater than others, depending on your attachment to the person or animal.

It is at times like these, when it feels natural to offer support and snippets of advice, but in fact, sometimes, just sitting quietly with the feelings of loss are the only way through.

I found myself doing this often in the early days after my sister died. It was impossible to make sense of what had just happened. Again, that is where the magic happens, because our body knows we are in pain and it behaves in a way that protects us on one level and on another level enables us to keep moving forward and get through each day.

This is by no means easy. Waking up was the hardest thing ever, for a split second everything was ‘normal’ and then you remember that everything is different and that it is never going to be the same again.

That was the worst feeling ever.

I learnt very early on that what we choose to think about (and remember we have a choice always) made a huge difference to the outcome of the day.  This did not mean all my early days were happy days, far from it, but it meant I had the power to shift thoughts slightly to at least get through the day.

It felt like having some power over a powerless situation. 

Some days it meant (privately) wallowing in the pain of it all, and other days getting out there and doing whatever needed doing.

This brings me back to the simple things in life. Simple things became really important, routine became a great support, and little achievements like making the bed each day, cooking, or working in the garden for an hour or so became the bedrock of some sort of normality returning. 

You don’t see it as this at the time, you’re just going through the motions with everything, but as time passes by, the building blocks of life start to go upwards again.

There will be some false starts along the way, and there will be many triggers that will upset you and take you back to another time and place. 

If anything, as devastating as it was to loose my sister (nearly 5 years ago) it has led me on a path that I never imagined. Sharing my thoughts here with you was not something on my radar even a couple of years ago.

I suppose, what I’m trying to say is, be open to new experiences and don’t expect to do things as you did them before loss.

Accept how you feel in any given moment, don’t fight it just accept it.

Be gentle on yourself. 

Be gentle on other people, no one but you, really knows how you feel.

Don’t expect other people to necessarily understand what you’re going through. 

Dig deep to keep compassion nearby and kindness in the frame.

If you feel like it share how you feel, if you don’t that’s ok too.

There are no set rules to any of this. Make the rules up as you go.

Follow your heart. 

I pause, as I look back, and remember that because of my sister’s death and, that of Jenny, I’m now completing my 30th blog. 
Does that fill me with joy or sadness?

A bit of both I suppose, sat here reflecting, I feel at peace as I write, but oh what I would give to have them both here now with me, sharing a mug of tea and a piece of cake!

Yes, life does go on, but differently and dare I say it richer for having had these beautiful souls in my life. 

They may not be here physically now, but on many levels they are larger than life itself now, and that is something that only comes with time. In the early days, the pain is too great, now I feel their wonderful influence on me in so many things that I do and think. That is, indeed a blessing.

As this blog comes to a close, I again feel immense gratitude for all the things I’m learning as life goes on after bereavement.

I am eternally grateful to Jenny and my sister for being beacons of light in a sometimes dark and grey world. It has taken time to see this, and a choice too.

There is no better way to move forward than into the light…

This by the way, is going to be a good day, I can feel it in my bones ☺
