It seems only yesterday I was writing an autumnal blog, and yet a year has passed. I know in my heart that time is creating a bigger space, day by day, between me and the people I love and miss. 

There is a heightened awareness in your life once you have been through a close bereavement.  There is no set formula to follow and everyone feels things differently, so one size definitely does not fit all. 

I’m not getting very far and have decided the best thing is to just write.

I find myself in this place so often, I’m happy just being and not doing, WHEN I don’t compare myself to other people. Always a good plan!

I’m happy here, in this very quiet corner of the world, far away from the seemingly maddening crowds of towns and cities. Some days their appeal calls, but today is not one of those days, I hear the call of the sea and again rejoice in living on the Edge. 

Sometimes when I feel the need to write this sort of thing down, I do question myself for a moment or two. Then I realize it’s similar to an affirmation – I am happy living here! However, when I do that, there is a growing realization that I do want to communicate with others and feel in some way connected to the rest of the world. 

Pausing to look out the window, I see a quiet road and grey skies, the leaves are still on the trees, but the next blustery day will see them falling to the ground below, like snowflakes on a winters day. 

Patterns of Light, my sanctuary today, and there have been patterns of light when the sun has graced me with a welcome appearance from behind the clouds.

These times always remind me of Jenny, and I enjoy the moments of solitude between chatting to visitors.

It has been a wet summer and although the joy of living in the Highlands can be overshadowed by the wet weather sometimes, it will only take one fine day to forget all the rainy days and remind us of the joys.

Glistening seas, gulls circling overhead, a heron wading on the foreshore, while oystercatchers take flight as a dog runs joyfully across the beach, a boat heads towards the boatyard and another heads west, out to sea. Never tiring of the sea views that bless us. The sunsets that set the sky on fire, and the moon rising behind the hills casting a shadowy glow across the sea, give connection in a disjointed world.

Seeking connection in nature is a wonderful cure for most ills.

Last week, saw us set sail to the Outer Hebrides and under a blue sky we headed further westwards. It was perfect, calm seas, the occasional gannet flew alongside the boat and the odd puffin was spotted bobbing on the waves. As one shore faded into the distance, a new shore beckoned.

With great excitement we headed to one of the many stunning beaches on Harris and it was not long before I was walking barefoot along the shoreline, stopping regularly to check out the numerous shells that littered the shoreline. 

I am reminded again that it’s the small things in life that make the world go round.

Our days were filled with exploring new beaches and stepping back in time with a wonderfully reconstructed iron age house one day and a 1950’s black house another. 

Although much time was spent on the coast, we delighted in a holiday cottage with an inland view across moors, lochans (small lochs) and distant hills. It was this contrast that made coming home all the more magical as the tides reminded me of the impending full moon. 

Waiting patiently to catch a glimpse of the full moon, in between all the rain and cloud, I was rewarded with a few minutes of brightness and beauty, until next time! Yes, it’s the small things that bring joy, and a sense of belonging. 

May your days be full of small magical moments that make the sad times easier to bear. With gratitude ☺
