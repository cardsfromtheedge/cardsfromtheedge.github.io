<blockquote><p>“Self-published and raising funds for the Highland Hospice, Cards from the Edge will take you on a short journey of creativity and love from one friend to another by way of full STOPs and smileys! The cards were written during a short spell in a lifetime of magical moments, often lit by candles and always followed by our friend the moon.</p>

<p>The book, which costs £15, is available now (November 2015). It is a beautiful 8x8″ hardback gift book, full of love, photos, daily musings and the author’s tentative creativity. Written overlooking the Edge (the Edge being the coast overlooking the sea) and often while eating a late breakfast!”</p></blockquote>

Having had a very late breakfast today, ☺ I paused to ponder what was needed next on my journey. A blog came to mind, as it’s something I’ve been putting off. I have spent several years reading other people’s blogs and always felt grateful for the wonderful words shared. So here we are on a rainy afternoon blogging! 

My 1st book may seem as though it’s about death, but it’s very much about life…
Life is what you make it and after losing a very close friend and then my beloved sister, I woke up to find my life changed forever. I made a choice, looking back it seemed such a harsh one to make - “I’ll not let this ruin my life” -were the words spoken on the day my sister’s body was found. Even writing it now I feel a slight tension in my self, and pause for a moment to remind myself it was the right choice. I know in my heart my sister would have chosen to do the same had the tables been turned, a big sigh follows, but life does indeed go on.

I will tell that story one day, but for now, this is the story of letting go and moving on creatively as my future unfolds as a budding author. No one is more surprised than me, and I find great delight in the word author, mulling it over and over in my mind. I have kept clear of labels for many years, a feeling of not having one and not really wanting one. The most recent label, prior to author was Independent Ski Consultant. Thank you to the wonderful friend who gave me that one – I love it. ☺ It involves lots of laughing, hot chocolate drinking, falling over in soft snow and is often followed by great live music. All of which, involves letting go and following the flow of life.

Cards from the Edge, is the result of letting life flow through me, and allowing a guiding light to shine where once there was only darkness. It has not happened over night and sometimes, even now I wonder where it has come from. There are still the odd dark moments, but as I always tell myself, it will pass and invariably it does.  

I have taken another small step today, on the big journey called life. Make that step yourself because however small, you may be amazed where it takes you. ☺
