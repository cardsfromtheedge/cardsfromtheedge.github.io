There are cycles in life and the more I look the more I see them in my own life. Coming full circle hit me the other day on a walk to the nearby beach, everywhere I looked I saw the seeds that had been planted as a young girl that are now the full-filled dream. I was rather gratified to realize the aspirations I’d had many moons ago had come to fruition. Why hadn’t I noticed them before now? Maybe, sometimes when we’re caught up in the busy-ness of life we do not notice our long-term dreams becoming our reality. Never before, had I realized this more than on this short walk down memory lane. I saw houses I dreamt of living in right by the sea and suddenly it all made sense, that’s what I do! I live right by the sea. It’s taken nearly 30 years to get there, but I’ve arrived. And never before have I felt the deep gratitude I now feel for my home. 

I stood on the beach looking out to sea and a bright sky darkened as an ominous black cloud gathered to the south obscuring the sun and the wind beat against my face, I knew I’d made my dreams come true. It wasn’t this beach or that house, and this view, but all the same I now know what it feels like to be at home right by the sea and it feels good. I started to wonder whether I had taken some of it for granted over the last couple of years. Tears welled up and in an instant I knew that wasn’t the case at all. It was the ache of loss that overwhelmed me right in the middle of all this joy and gratitude. As usual, it came uninvited and certainly I was ill prepared (no tissues to be found!), I allowed the tears to flow and once again I felt the loss fully and allowed the sea breeze to take it away from me, and as I did that I felt another burden float away on the horizon.

That’s the thing with grief, it ebbs and flows like the tides and although one minute you can be rejoicing in your wonderful life, the next minute you can be consumed with sadness of what was and what could have been. I read a beautiful quote recently that explained grief perfectly, it talked about absorption, adjustment and acceptance. That’s exactly it—you absorb a death, then you adjust to it and finally accept it. It’s a process and it’s a part of life, because, in an uncertain world one thing that is certain, is eventual death. So I tell myself to live in the moment and be present, I relish the sea breeze on my face again, and enjoy the waves rolling in once more before I turn, and head inland, back down memory lane. My sadness eased with every step, and joy thankfully was only a matter of moments away. As always, with love and gratitude ☺
