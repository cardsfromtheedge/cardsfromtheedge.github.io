In between, dwelling on death, and bereavement thriving (I was going to put survival, but we’re here to thrive, so much more than survive), life does indeed go on, and often before you know it many weeks/months have passed.

Then something happens and you’re back in the early days again.

Christmas is a time that often triggers thoughts and emotions of days gone by, my heart always goes out to people who have lost a loved one recently.

I’m finding that life is OK post bereavement. I’ve actively chosen thoughts that have supported a way of thriving, rather than just surviving. It has been time consuming some days, but I feel like I’m beginning to see a new light at the end of the proverbial tunnel.

That was until, on a ‘normal’ day, while driving into town to get some shopping I found myself full of anxiety.

Having worked hard to feel OK in a so often scary world, I was shocked at how strong the feelings were. I shared them with my husband and we gently went about our business, ticking off the things to do on the shopping list.  

It was manageable, as I had shared my feelings.

They persisted for most of the day. I allowed the feelings to be there, and acknowledged them. I didn’t try to fix them or chase them away, just let them be.

The following day, feeling like there was nothing I could do to change the massive problems in the world or in my head at that moment, I took a deep breath and thought *‘what can I do?’*

I took to social media, and with loving intention, liked/loved as many posts as possible that resonated with me, I commented on friend’s posts, sending good wishes out into the world in my own heart-centred way.

It felt good as ripples of kindness were beamed out into the world.

You see the only thing I could think of doing was to spread some joy and happiness, with friends and family. I thought that if I’m feeling a bit vulnerable, then, maybe other people were feeling the same. 

In opening my heart to others and what they may be going through, it opened my heart, and allowed some of the anxiety to dissolve as I realised we’re all in this together.

We are all connected, every little moment of kindness or compassion you have in a day, may seem small, but it may also have a greater impact than you’ll ever know. 

It is certainly how I feel when someone takes the time to comment on a post or sends a message. A minute taken to comment can give a day’s worth of warmth and friendship.

It was my intention to shift my own emotion by focusing on, encouraging and supporting others. It reminded me that it is the little acts of kindness that we can often do that effortlessly have great impact.

*So next time, you feel anxious, maybe go and take some time out to focus on others.* 

It reminds me of the book I’m currently reading – The Book of Joy by His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu – in it, it mentions focusing on others wellbeing as a way to improve your own. 

It brings to mind that being of service is key to life…

There is so much wisdom in this book, and I’m feeling grateful to the friend who recommended it. It’s a book that needs to be read slowly and digested deeply!

It would make a brilliant book for schools to include on reading lists for a better future – one with more kindness and compassion.

As I look out on the pine tress, and the enchanting fir tree all lit up with fairy lights, a feeling of deep gratitude fills me as the snow settles on its branches adding to the magic. Again, realising how powerful, small acts with good intention, are and how they shape our lives.

I reflect on today’s tiny acts (all done while ‘recharging my batteries’ after a busy few days) - going to the shop to buy breakfast for someone who has work to do, washing the dishes, hand washing the top that needed extra TLC, making the bed, chatting to my family online, pulling angel cards to inspire, making time to meditate and finishing the meditation by sending LOVE out into the world (often seen as sprinkling ‘fairy sparkles’ of love over everyone!) eating some dark chocolate as a treat and writing the next blog…

May your day be a productive one however tiny your acts of kindness are.

Whether they are acts of kindness towards your self or acts of kindness towards another, feel the love in your heart as you carry them out. You never know the impact they may have on someone else.

A friend has just sent a text and although the consensus was to stay in and relax, the simple act of asking about meeting up has filled my heart with joy!

As always, it is the simple things in life.

May the New Year as it unfolds, bring simplicity and joy to your life if it is feeling overcrowded. 

With gratitude for the dawning of a New Year, wishing you Joy and Peace, and remember that no act of kindness is too small. ☺
