Have you noticed that? Midsummer comes round so quickly, it seems. Some say it’s a sign of getting older…

Since I last wrote, we have been blessed with wonderful weather, not days upon days, but weeks upon weeks. Almost unheard of in The Highlands! ☺

With the last blog on my mind, it seems that Heaven on Earth has stayed for a while. 

Days have been long and warm. The garden has blossomed and the grass continually needs cutting. The swallows have re-built their nest and the midges, along with the tourists have returned.  

Every day has felt like a blessing, and work around the house has been completed with ease. Time has been taken out to just sit and enjoy the moment.

There have been some unforeseen challenges recently, but there has been an endeavor to handle them with grace and compassion.  Some things have been in our control and others have not.

I look up at the scene in front of me…

It has been a stormy morning today, and my beloved ash tree has lost a big branch in the strong wings. Our beautiful birch in the courtyard has been bent over double several times. 

The waves have been rolling into shore and now as the tide recedes, the view ahead seems marginally calmer.

The weather today sums up how life has been recently, it feels as though I’ve been weathering an internal storm. Like the trees, I feel buffeted about by life events, but like the trees too, I’ve bent and bowed to withstand what’s been thrown my way.

It finally feels good looking back at how I’ve navigated through the last couple of months. Nothing major has happened as such, but events have created unwelcome stresses. Things like the car breaking down, then the washing machine, and the need for fencing reinforcements due to deer damage, and in between all of these things, family visits both home and away.

To coin a modern cliché – they are all first world problems…

So, sat here writing about it, makes me realise (yet again) how incredibly grateful I am for what I’ve learnt and am still learning about how to navigate this thing called life!

And bang on queue, the clouds are lifting and the sky is getting brighter. 

The wind is still strong, so we’ll hang on to our hats a bit longer! How do birds fly in this sort of wild weather?

The swallows nesting on the verandah are bringing so much joy this summer. They have got used to us sitting out there with them. Sometimes they fly so close, I automatically duck ☺ and today they have been seen flying about, in even the strongest gusts. 

Yesterday morning, I counted 8 thrushes on the lawn – a record, and when the rain came later in the afternoon after weeks of dry, sunny days, the blackbirds had a field day eating worms.

Having lost sight of what to write and why, I find it’s the simple pleasures in life that often bring the most joy. It’s the sitting down and just being that gives the space to appreciate everything around us.

Highland living may have its drawbacks, but the rewards are immense.

Even on this stormy day, it is wonderful to feel the strength of the house around us, the wind whistling in the chimney flue and the clouds scudding past. 

Like life, we weather the storm, and know that we can take the rough with the smooth, the sadness and the joyfulness. 

Tomorrow is another day, may it be a calm one. 

Feeling gratitude, for joining me through the storm. ☺
