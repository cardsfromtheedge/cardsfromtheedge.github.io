While still feeling the need for action, I felt it was a good idea to write some more. So hot on the back of yesterday’s blog post, I find myself writing again.

I ended the last post hopeful, that Spring was just around the corner, however it is still snowing. It’s been snowing all day and I gather there’s snow in lots of places.

It looks like Narnia outside, all magical and white. I’ve not ventured out today, it was a good excuse to catch up with family and keep the washing machine going on the seemingly, never ending wash cycle that it’s on at the moment.

I look up for a moment and out the window towards ‘my’ fir tree that keeps me company in these moments, and I pause to ponder, the never-ending cycles that some things seem to take. That’s how the snow feels at the moment, and as you know I love the snow, but it’s never ending currently. 

I am ready for the Spring… ☺ 

Another pause… 

How does that make me feel? 

Nostalgic, sad, yet excited for the future and eager to keep moving forward.

*How are you feeling right now?*

I love the changing seasons, and as ready as I feel today for Spring to arrive, I also know I’ll be ready for the next ski season when it arrives too. I’m not rushing ahead, wishing my days away, no, not at all.

Just acknowledging that it is time! Preparing for the migration northwards.

Looking forward to reconnecting with friends and family…

Preparing for the rush of the coming weeks, as time will definitely speed up, it always does. 

This blog feels short and sweet, but it also feels complete…

With gratitude for this life we lead and for the friends we’ve made along the way. Sending blessing out into the world, may your day be filled with love and much laughter ☺
