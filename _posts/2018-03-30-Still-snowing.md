While still feeling the need for action, I felt it was a good idea to write some more. So hot on the back of the last blog post, I find myself writing again.

I ended the last post hopeful, that Spring was just around the corner, however it continues to snow. It’s been snowing all day and I gather there’s still snow in lots of other places.

It looks like Narnia outside, all magical and white. I’ve not ventured out today, it was a good excuse to catch up with family, and keep the washing machine going, on a seemingly, never ending wash cycle.

I look up for a moment and out the window, towards ‘my’ fir tree that keeps me company in these moments, and I pause to ponder, the never-ending cycles that some things seem to take in life. That’s how the snow feels at this point in time, and as you know I love the snow, but it’s feels a bit never ending right now.  

I am ready for the Spring… ready for many days of blue sky and sunshine ☺ 

Another pause… 

How does that make me feel? 

Nostalgic, sad, yet excited for the future and eager to keep moving forward.

*How are you feeling right now?*

I love the changing seasons, and as ready as I feel today for Spring to arrive, I also know I’ll be ready for the next ski season when it arrives too. I’m not rushing ahead, wishing my days away, no, not at all.

Just acknowledging that it is time! Preparing for the migration northwards.

Looking forward to reconnecting with friends and family…

Preparing for the rush of the coming weeks, as time will definitely speed up, it always does. 

This blog feels short and sweet, but it also feels complete…

Another week or so has passed since I started writing this blog, and the Spring Equinox has been and gone, the days are longer and still we see snow flurries in between the sunshine and cloud.

I tell myself, it’s warmer, it’s almost April after all ☺

With gratitude for this life we lead and for the friends we’ve made along the way. Sending blessings out into the world, may your days be filled with love and much laughter ☺
