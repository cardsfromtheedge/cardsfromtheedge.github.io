It was my wish that if I could make a difference to just one person, then all the hard work over the last couple of years would be worthwhile. To my delight, I am already feeling the ripple effect moving outwards as I talk to friends and family. I have been overwhelmed by the support and encouragement I have received from so many, helping me make this dream a reality. I wrote the following quote to complete the introduction to Cards from the Edge -

<blockquote>“May your days be full of love with peace all around you, and may you feel inspired to create.”</blockquote>

When facing death everyone has their own path to take, but I found facing a close friends death with creativity, unknowingly at the time, lit both our paths onwards. It is from this place of creative light that I want to shine more brightly as the weeks, months and years go by.  If you would like to join me on this journey, you would be most welcome. From one shining star to another, as I say in Cards from the Edge be uplifted and inspired to create, and make your heart sing.

Here is the wonderful endorsement I received from a friend, fellow author and one of the Co-Founders of Indie Authors World <a href="http://www.indieauthorsworld.com">http://www.indieauthorsworld.com</a> who have been instrumental in the creation of this book -
“Cards from the Edge, is such a wonderful book. From the simplicity of the idea to the beautiful pictures and heartfelt words it really does lift your spirits. The love and kindness between Jo and Jenny flows from each page and is very infectious. It has encouraged me to send my own words of encouragement to a friend going through a tough time. Please buy the book, take time to feel inspired and continue the flow of kindness and compassion as you help raise funds for a very worthwhile cause.” Kim Macleod, Author of From Heartbreak to Happiness

As I walk my talk, I would like to finish this blog with heartfelt gratitude to some of the amazing people who have been so influential in me finding my life flow again. First mention must go to Alisoun Mackenzie, author of Heartatude – The 9 Principles of Heart-Centred Success, who suggested I went to the Glasgow Hay House ‘I Can Do It’ Conference in 2013. Also, everyone at the Heartabiz Hub <a href="http://www.alisoun.com">http://www.alisoun.com</a> who have spurred me onwards! Thank you ☺

And last but not least, David R. Hamilton PhD for his inspirational 5 day Integrating Science Coaching Seminar in 2014.
