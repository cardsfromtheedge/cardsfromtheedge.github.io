Once you’ve got your breathing sorted (see previous blog), you can write ☺ 

Another late night remembered - during the creation of *Cards from the Edge*. I had been asked to include an Author page in the book. Not something I’d thought about before and I was pondering how to write something about myself, it truly felt an impossible task!  

And then, something magically happened I wrote from the heart and the following appeared in front of me. I loved my free spirit shining through and wondered if it would work for the Author page. Suddenly I could feel FEAR knocking on my inner door. *What would people think of me? What would they say? Would they laugh at me? Would they wonder what qualifications I have? Would they judge me?*

I stopped for a moment and thought about all these fears and started to smile at myself. They are the common fears we all have at times, and it would have been easy to let them take over. *Does this sound familiar? Take a moment to acknowledge a fear you’ve often held on to, then let it go - blow it away with a kiss and smile if need be, but LET IT GO.*

Back on The Edge, I was keen to get the book manuscript to the publishers, and didn’t want to delay it any longer.  Consequently, I thought as I often do at times of stress F**k-it and sent it in anyway ☺ (Thank you, John C. Parkin for this inspiration – do take a look at [http://thefuckitlife.com/](http://thefuckitlife.com/)

I’m so glad that I trusted my intuition and kept to the original piece. It would have been easy to try to big myself up and include many other (not very interesting) things. But my motivation was simple – to illustrate that you don’t need a long list of qualifications after your name, or a high-flying job to publish a book. You just need to follow your heart, or have a burning desire to make a difference to your own life. Then maybe, just maybe you’ll help some one else in the process, on their journey ☺ 
 
And, here it is, my 1st and last attempt at the wording for the Authors page. I smile and realize that yet again I am my own teacher.  To laugh at one’s self is definitely therapeutic and so often I have taken myself far too seriously through life:– 

<blockquote>“If I had to sum me up in a few words, it would be self-confessed ski bum and dedicated meditator who dreams vividly!”
<br><br>
Jo Turner is a writer and poet, who loves taking photos, teaches meditation, practices EFT and is studying at the university of life, in between making dream-catchers. Having realized that it takes a lifetime to learn how to live, she knows she's a work in progress, but that living from the heart is the way forward. Due to recent life experiences, she knows of loss and pain, which affirmed the value of meditating daily, being in nature as often as possible, feeling gratitude, and listening to her intuition among many things.  This has become a full time job in recent years!”</blockquote>


As always with Gratitude for reading this far, have a fun filled day of creativity wherever you are, and whatever you’re doing, do it with Love ☺
