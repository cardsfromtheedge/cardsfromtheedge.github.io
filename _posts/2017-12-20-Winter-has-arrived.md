After a dusting of snow early on in November, we have enjoyed more snow, which thankfully has not settled at sea level. It is a stark reminder that winter is well and truly here.

There have been many rainbows and some ‘moments’ on the roads when venturing on to higher ground. I know for many people there is a preference for warmer weather, but for me the first sighting of snow always brings great excitement and joy.

It means the ski season is nearly upon us and I get to wrap up warm and get out on the mountain. Before this can happen, we need to get organized and make the long trek southwards.

Like, migrating birds, we too head south… ☺

The last few weeks have been busy, but calmness is beginning to settle over me, as most things that need doing are done, and the other things are not as important, as I first thought.

But some things are way more important…

While I write this, a candle burns brightly, and I imagine the angels gathering as the flame flickers. The sun has long set and the snow has now blocked the road over the Pass. We made it over there one more time just before the snow gates were closed. 

Pausing for a moment, I wring my hands trying to work out how to articulate what’s going on right now….

This particular candle was lit, as tragically another incredible soul has departed this earthly plane, and it hurts. We only knew this gem of a man through our local pub, but his impact in the world has been immense. 

It was always a pleasure to be greeted by Ali on arrival at the Inn and recently we had the unexpected pleasure of his company at a fantastic music gig on the Isle of Skye – The Red Dirt Skinners - all the way from Canada.

To quote Ali - “The Skinners were awesome, soprano sax with guitar and vocals were immense”.

I will always think of Ali when I listen to the CD’s that we purchased at the gig. It was with a heavy heart, that I wrote to The Skinners to tell them the tragic news. We had talked about their return UK tour in 2019 with the idea of coming to Applecross. Here’s hoping they still do.

My sincere and heartfelt condolences go out to Ali’s family at this difficult time. I have not met them, and yet, as was mentioned on his blog so many knew him. He was loved and admired by many, and he led a public life in his community.

At a time like this privacy is needed, but a missing person brings media attention.

When my sister went missing nearly 5 years ago, my family showed great courage (her body was found a month later), and now I watch from afar as another family does the same and starts the long path to getting used to life without their loved one. 

I have often said to folk, that you do not get over the death of a partner, a close relative or friend. Although you learn to live along side the loss, it is felt deeply and many days drift by in a blur, and then one day you might look back and think, where have the last few years gone.

Yet here, it is very early days, and as a whole community comes to terms with such a devastating loss, I feel their pain and my own resurfaces, having a sense of what they are going through.

It is a time when family and friends pull together, and the word community takes on a whole new meaning.

When you live by the sea, no matter how much you love it, there is always an awareness of the power of the ocean, and it is humbling to remember how powerful and dangerous it can be sometimes, even on a calm day.

Pausing again as I type, I sigh, as I’m not sure if I’ll even publish this blog post… 

Everything feels too raw, too real, too close, too soon. 

It took me years to start writing after my sister passed away, but it was her memory, and that of Jenny (Cards from the Edge ‘co-founder’) that silently encouraged me onwards.

So with that in mind, I give immense thanks to Ali for his inspiration. In being so open and honest in his blogging, it has on this occasion helped me along with my efforts to make a small difference in the world. He is a true Local Hero.  

I only wished I’d known him better, and as always I truly thought there was plenty of time…

Again, we are all reminded of the fragility of life. 

The present moment is all we ever really have. 

With Love and Sadness this post comes to a close, but with Gratitude quietly in the background for days gone by, may the music play on...
