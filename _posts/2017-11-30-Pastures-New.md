My intention now is to write more…I laugh to myself as I read that as it sounds like a New Year resolution! Not as funny as it may seem, as last night was Halloween and in the Celtic year this is indeed New Year. Maybe I’m finally finding my place in the world.

Being by the sea has enabled a true sense of the ebb and flow of life, and post-bereavement certainly seems to need the stability of something so constant, yet ever changing. It allows time to reflect and just be, and instead of you doing all the moving the sea does it for you! ☺

Smiling to myself again, I ponder the implications of what I’ve just written. Life is a constant while we are here on mother earth, yet life is constantly changing like the ocean.

We need to constantly ebb and flow like the tides, or if you prefer, come and go like the sun and the moon.

Looking out across the sea for a moment, I feel blessed to make time for these insights. 

It’s been an incredibly busy time on the Edge over the last few months. There have been lots of lovely visits from friends and family, and several trips away. One recent adventure took me to the beautiful seaside town of North Berwick, and the delightful and inspirational Barefoot Sanctuary - <a href="http://www.barefootambition.co.uk/the-barefoot-sanctuary/">http://www.barefootambition.co.uk/</a> 

Thank you to Bernie for creating such a gorgeous space ☺

It was one of those defining moments when I knew I had to be on a particular workshop. I held back from booking as we had been so busy, but my heart knew otherwise and after several gentle nudges, I decided to go. And once the decision was made, the Universe helped everything else fall into place!

The day before the workshop was truly magical! Blue skies greeted me as I headed out for the day, and within a few minutes drive, as I came over the crest of a hill, there were wonderful, far-reaching sea views across to Fife.

Parking the car, I noticed the withered Sunflower heads in the field opposite. Although, they looked past their best, there was a lingering beauty in the sunshine, and thoughts of the smiles I’m sure they had delivered during the summer, made me smile in that moment, as they waited for their seeds to be collected. 

Everything indeed, has its time and place.  

As I sat in the car looking out I felt immense gratitude for the opportunities that have come my way, I started to realise that there was plenty more to come and with that, jumped out the car to greet the day! ☺

Breakfast with lovely friends, was followed by a peaceful walk through beautiful willow structures, my favourite being a stunning willow yurt. Reminding me of many happy times in Jenny’s yurt, I spent a little longer there... 

Then onwards, through a fairy woodland garden which definitely brought out the inner child in me, and after some light refreshments, a hike up the Law, a local landmark.

It’s an ancient hill with a very steep climb to the top, where you are rewarded with the most spectacular and far-reaching views in all directions, both seawards and inland. The day was topped off with a relaxing hour or so at a spa with a dear friend – such a rare treat!

A wonderful day of being outside, felt perfect preparation for a day going within…

Amusingly, the reason I gave myself for attending this particular workshop did not actually materialize! However, there was great personal insight into trusting our intuition more, going within, and how incredibly powerful and life enhancing this is.

We really do have all the answers within.

Having been a regular meditator for many years, I often forget the power of guided meditations.  A truly nurturing day spent with other like-minded souls - always a delight ☺

Time and again, I forget and have to remind myself of these gifts we all carry within us. We are all in the right place at the right time, letting go of what you think you ought to be and accepting who you are is a gateway to freedom in my book, so…

GO FOR THAT WALK, MAKE TIME TO MEDITATE, TRY YOGA, LEARN TO PAINT, DANCE TO THAT SONG, SING YOUR HEART OUT, OR SEND THAT CARD…

General reminders to my self as much as reminders to you, about doing things that make your heart sing in between all the stresses and strains of daily life. With this in mind, I’m off down the beach to enjoy the blustery breeze for a while.  

With gratitude for living by the sea, and to you for reading all about it! ☺
