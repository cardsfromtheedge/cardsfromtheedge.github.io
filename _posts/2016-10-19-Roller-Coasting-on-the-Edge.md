Oh my goodness, what a time it has been. How quickly things can change! I have been feeling stuck and quite honestly struggling to get to grips with life over the last few weeks. Everything appeared fine on the surface, but under the calm sea there was a storm brewing and like so many times before, I just didn’t see it coming and certainly felt stuck in the process of it all. My sister used to tell me off for saying “I’m fine”. It has a sense of not being authentic and honest, and she was right, it’s easy to say, “I’m fine”. It brushes whatever is bothering us under the carpet and with a bit of luck we can forget it’s even there!

I kept looking out to sea and asking silently what was wrong in this wonderful life? I checked in with gratitude and effortlessly repeated my mantra, I sought out uplifting quotes and tried to find passion again. Some days have been wonderful and others have not. Normal life I hear you say…and you’d be absolutely right, it is indeed! ☺

You see the success thing was still bugging me and I was stalling on various things that would move me forward. I now see that I just needed to let go and it would all be OK in the end. It is in the darkest moments that you need support and a gentle reminder that you are not alone. Perfectly timed - I had the pleasure of reconnecting with friends. Time spent creating and/or experiencing things, always fills your proverbial cup up so much more than material stuff.  Looking back, I feel truly grateful for those wonderful memories. I was silently and rather unknowingly letting go of what was bothering me.

However, when the fun had ended and everyone had gone home, and all was quiet, I was left with an aloneness that didn’t seem much fun… I had a choice to make, face it or bury it again. Luckily, I had a shiatsu appointment scheduled and during this session took the time to honour the pain within my heart. It came flooding out after a wonderful week full of fun, friendship and future plans. It was not expected and at times, certainly not welcome. But, as I write this blog late one night, I know that yet again something has shifted within. As I acknowledge the losses in my life and start to embrace my future self, in all her forms, I know I am moving forward again. ☺ I cannot stress enough how much self-care helps in coping with the curved balls life throws at us from time to time. So, it is with a grateful heart that I head to bed for what I hope will be a good nights sleep, after another day full of feeling pain and letting go. As always, with love and gratitude for reading this blog. ☺
