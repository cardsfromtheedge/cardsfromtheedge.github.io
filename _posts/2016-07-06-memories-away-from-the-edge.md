I was sat having lunch one day, and as I so often do, I looked out on the lovely view, and as it sunk in that the snow angel had truly gone for the year, I smiled, realising she had been replaced by an otters face! Not quite in the same place but slightly over to the right. I sat there pondering the message in this? *What’s left will always be right!* 

Let me explain… During the winter months, I have the pleasure of looking out on a beautiful snowy mountain across the valley, and as the days of winter turn into spring, the shapes in the snow-covered peaks constantly change. I’ve watched my ‘snow angel’ over 4 wonderful winters from that window, and she’s kept me company when I’ve felt alone.  She comes and goes each season, but I’ve never questioned her about where she goes in between! This year is different though, she’d gone without a wave goodbye, no looking back and for several days I earnestly looked for her in the snow, but, alas she had gone and then a few days later, I spotted it, the otters face and I smiled as I thanked the snow angel for her company and pondered the new kid on the block. He made me smile and reminded me of my self-publishing logo, he was big and had a huge smile on his face too.  I wondered how long he would stay.

*Do you see things that sometimes no one else can see? Do you take messages from these things?*  It’s not something I’ve always done, but some times the message is too loud to ignore. This message seemed to be about writing again. For several days I’d felt stuck and was just going with the flow of life, but no words would come. I’m learning to stay with it and allow the words to flow when they are good and ready. I’m discovering you cannot force these things. Today, that changed because when I remembered looking out at the otter, I knew I must write about him. Otters are playful and I’ve chosen them in my life to remind me to be playful and to choose happy again and again. 

So, it is very fitting that earlier this year, I was given a beautiful toy otter for my big-O birthday by a dear friend. Little did I know, how much joy he would bring into my life! His name is Oscar and like the otter in the snow, he brings great comfort to me when I’m alone.  He reminds me that we are never truly alone and like so many things I’m becoming aware of, we can choose how we feel, pretty much about everything. It has reminded me, that having any kind of furry friend in your life can make a real difference to your world. For many years I had cats, and each time one of them passed away, a little bit of my heart went with them, and as having pets is not practical right now, I cherish the new additions to the household! For that reason, Oscar now sits alongside Simon, the nautical cat – another lovely gift who manages to fool even us sometimes, he’s so life like! ☺

Remember that you are never too old for a soft toy in your life either, and often it’s the little things that make the biggest difference to your day. Finally, thank you to the otter face in the snow for reminding me to have fun and to keep writing! As always with gratitude to *YOU* for reading this blog ☺
