For those of you that follow my blog, you will know that the last few weeks have been tinged with sadness. We have been reminded yet again that death is very much part of life.

To embrace death means to live a life well lived…

Ever since Jenny, followed very closely by my sister, passed away, I have focused on living a life well lived. It has been an uphill struggle at times. There is so much to come to terms with during bereavement. It takes time to readjust to the new way of living that inevitably comes along with it.

Embracing death feels like the way through it, rather than a way to avoid it. If we avoid death, we will live a life of fear, and that feels no life at all.

It has a grounding effect of making you focus on the present again and again.

Following these two deaths I found myself following blogs and social posts about good deaths, dealing with bereavement and generally choosing a life worth living. These were all ways to support me through the years that have followed.

The more I read, the more I came to understand that death, although unwelcome, especially if premature, was better embraced than shunned.

It was good to find people who were relatively comfortable about the subject. Many are not, and it would appear that as a society we do not normalize death, nor do we prepare people for the one thing guaranteed in life.

So, having decided to embrace life again, I was also inspired to embrace death more! Something my sister would be very happy about…

She was always talking about death, and if the only thing that I learn from these experiences is not to fear my own death, something will have been achieved. At this point, it is important to say it’s very much a work in progress.

Remember this is about living life to the full ☺

So, with that in mind, let me share with you some of the excitement of the last few days! We are back in the mountains and they are very snowy ones this year. The last few winters have suffered from variable snow conditions, but this winter has started with the most glorious snow in a long time.

To the non-skiers among you, this means, light fluffy powder snow deep on the mountain, which in turn means awesome days doing what we love - skiing. 

There is nothing more thrilling than making fresh tracks in unblemished snow!

For many this means getting out for first lifts and going wherever the next bit of untracked snow is. I confess I’m a bit more laid back about it, and get out there as and when. The joy of these experiences are not lessened, as the years go by, and there is a sense of being a child again, and certainly being totally in the present moment.
Many whoops of joy were heard on the mountain in those first few days. ☺
  
It is moments like these that reconnect you with joy and life. It’s makes life so worth living. 

*Are you doing what makes your heart sing?*

It takes time for joy to return after bereavement, but it will return and dare I say more frequently as time moves on. This can be a problem in itself, as there are sometimes, feelings of guilt that you are happy again without them.

I’m a great believer that almost all people who die would wish their family and friends left behind to find joy in life again. This is like giving oneself permission to be happy once more.

Again, this is a choice. It is a choice I made on Day One…

I was reminded of this earlier today, while reading a blog about Carpe Diem – Seize the day.

Take each moment, and there will be many in each day, and make it a magical moment. However small, as time moves on, each little moment gets added to other moments and then you’re looking back on days well lived, that turn into years of good memories.

Sad or bad things will sometimes happen, but your memory bank will focus on the magical moments and that helps you get through the not so good times.

All very easy sounding, but some effort is required to master this.

And that’s what I try to do, to navigate my way through the sea of life. 

To keep a proverbial even keel, to focus on the horizon and to ride the waves of unease, so that the result is a reasonably steady passage through life, whatever the weather throws in along the way…the skills are there to manage it. 

So back to the present moment… the here and now.

Dusk is fast approaching and sat here, the magical moments have been snowy ones (did I mention how bitterly cold it was out there today?) and I give thanks for the ability to go at my own pace and savour the moments as the day is seized!

May your moments be magical ones especially around Christmas and the New Year, not always an easy time for bereaved families, especially recently bereaved. 

I glance up in this moment, and feel immense gratitude for the huge outdoor Christmas tree that keeps me company each evening as nighttime falls. 

It is a gentle reminder to be grateful for the little things… 

I smile at my tiny Christmas tree that my sister once gave me. Forever in our hearts ☺
