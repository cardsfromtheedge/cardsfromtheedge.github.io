Following on from my last blog, it has been very much on my mind how powerful our thoughts are, and the impact they have on us.

I had just finished reading a book that had sat on the bookshelf for years, which made me revisit other unread books. The book I found is called “The only thing that matters” by Neale Donald Walsch (Conversations with God fame, if you’ve read any of those books), I remember buying it a few years ago at a Hay House “I Can Do It” conference. 

I noticed there was a bookmark in it and wondered why I’d not finished reading it. So, I decided to give it another go, and I’m reading it far more easily this time round. Isn’t it funny sometimes, how things come back to you at the right time for the right reason? 

The reason I started writing now, was that it dawned on me yet again – the only thing that matters – is Love. 

The reason behind this thought, was that I picked up the book to read some more, and from the back of the book, fell a photo of my lovely sister that I hadn’t realized was there.

I have no idea how the photo got there, but I thanked the Universe as it made me smile, as I remembered the only thing that matters. When we’re gone, the one thing that goes on and on, is Love. 

In that moment, I really missed my sister. It was a simple thought, I didn’t feel sad, more nostalgic for a moment I can never have again in this reality. A cup of tea with my sister and of course cake! ☺

This book had got me thinking again, and as if by divine timing over the last week or so, I’ve found myself withdrawing from the outside world. I’ve been finding great pleasure in being at home and letting each day unfold, some days have been busy and others delightfully calm and still, despite the weather outside being stormy, at times! 

My inner world has found peace again, and of course meditation has been a big part of the inner peacefulness and calm I feel. 

Once more, remembering that all the answers do indeed come from within, if you give yourself some quiet time.  If you remember to feel your way through life, making decisions on what to do, based on how you feel, life seems to flow effortlessly and what needs to be done, gets done and what is not so important dissolves effortlessly away. 

Remember that where our thoughts go, our energy does indeed flow.

Looking back, there is a knowing that for much of my life I had thought that being in control was the path to success, and for some I’m sure it may be, but for now, going with the flow is proving much more rewarding. 

There is a peacefulness that I have not known for a very long time. It may come with age, but I feel it’s more than that. It’s a knowing that our thoughts are our creator and, so to create good things, we need good thoughts, to have happy experiences, we need to have happy thoughts, and to have compassion in our lives, we need to have compassionate thoughts and so the list goes on.  

This is not new stuff, and just as I’m being reminded about all this in my current reading, I know that you know all this too. 

Initially when I started this blog, I had set out to offer you a short list of some of my favourite books, that have helped to rewire my brain over the years, some knowingly, some unknowingly and others profoundly.

Books are a bit like sweets in a shop! You can pick and mix till you find exactly what you are looking for.  

Each book, takes you on a journey of discovery, but often at the end of it, there is a knowing that you have been reminded of something you already knew… and so with my own conviction I’m going with the feeling, and when I went up to the book shelves to select some books for this list, I felt that there was no need to give you a list, because if you ask, you will receive. 

So do not be surprised if when you’re next in a bookstore or a library that a book jumps out at you (sometimes literally) and that is the one for you! 

Wishing you peace and joy, and may your path of discovery be an interesting one… now back to that book, as the last word I read was Gratitude and that’s where I always end! ☺
