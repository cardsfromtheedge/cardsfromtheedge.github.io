After a wonderful day out further north on the West Coast, and topically enough (see the previous blog post) visiting a rather delightful garden, I came home to find some events out of my control irritating me….

So irritating that I didn’t continue writing about them!  And now a month or so later, I laugh to myself because I haven’t a clue what that was all about! 

I thought about starting a new blog and abandoning this one, but it has made me think. It is often the case that something that seems so irritating one day, can be completely forgotten, in a few more.

In letting go of the first paragraph, but keeping it a part of the blog, I see with new eyes the simplicity of letting go, and living on with acceptance.

There has been a lot of ‘work’ on acceptance this year, as writing has not flowed as much as I wanted it to. I have again and again reminded myself to go with the flow ☺

And it seems that, all of a sudden, here we are at the beginning of November already, and what pops up on my FB memories? But the blog I posted a year ago. I re-read it, and confess, I enjoyed reading my own words. It has spurred me on again.

Much time has been spent going inwards over recent years, and now it feels as though it is time to go outwards a bit more. Tiny steps, tiny steps ☺

And as if the Universe has a better plan for me now, I’m about to go with the flow, and head out into the forest for an impromptu walk (even in the rain) with a friend, instead of finishing this blog post.

Hold that thought…. I’ll be back. X

That was so refreshing, and yes, at times soggy, but it has cleared my mind and given me a wonderful energy boost. 

The woods were still and wet, the only sound being from the myriad of tiny burns (streams) in full flow with all the recent rain. The bright green moss seemed to glow ethereally below the conifers, and the sea, glimpsed through the occasional gap in the woods, was still and calm. There is snow on the mountaintops giving everything a magical hint of things to come. ☺

It was one of those magical moments, when I thought to myself - must do this more often. It felt good to be moving at a steady pace, chatting away and exchanging views and ideas, stopping occasionally when we hit upon something that needed our full attention.

It has reminded me again how much reaching out to friends can be such a great tonic for all involved, especially impromptu things, like todays walk. Totally happy indoors starting to write again, but given the chance to go for a walk, it was an easy decision to head out into the forestry.

The more I ponder life, the more, I appreciate how it’s the simple things that bring joy, and how easy it is to loose sight of that fact. 

Although I very rarely watch the news on TV, recently, I have been reading rather a lot of news on-line. It’s an endeavour to keep abreast of current affairs and not have my head in the proverbial sand. Easily done, when living so remotely from what some may see as mainstream life.

However, the more I read, the more I feel, time and again, that simplicity in life really is the way forward, for me at least. 

Not that it guarantees simplicity sometimes life gets in the way. That’s when getting out and about in nature, getting some gardening done (if the Highland weather allows), taking the time to phone a friend rather than just sending a text, being drawn to a book or an article because it feels the right one to explore, trusting our gut feelings about decisions that need making and generally making the time to allow life to flow.

Looking back, I realise how often I have forced life, because subconsciously, I believed that was what was expected. That was how we got results; that was what we were taught; and sadly that is what so many people are still doing.

Once we remember that there is a flow to life, our energy gets freed up, and of course, energy flows where your attention goes… so when we start focusing on what we love, enjoy, and appreciate, more of what you focus on, appears in your life.

It really is that simple…

But it’s easy to loose sight of that, all too often these days. I am constantly reminding myself, of these simple life skills that we were not taught at school – trusting our gut feeling, our intuition, and letting our imagination run wild and free.

With an element of relief and great joy I am seeing more and more, how going with the flow can really help us along the way. 

There are times as I’ve mentioned before, when things have to be done, but also there are many times when we do things that we would rather not! When we are true to ourselves, it becomes so much easier to be true to others. 

Today I’ve followed my heart in everything I’ve done.

Yes, there have been things that needed doing, but there have been other things that have happened as life flows.  

*Have you followed your heart at all today?*

The most important things today, have been walking in the forestry with a friend, chatting to a childhood friend who was asking for some advice, which had me doing a wee bit of research and also chatting to family about various challenges we are experiencing currently.

All of the above are about love, friendship, family, and kindness ☺

All the important things in life… 

There are always challenges in life, but how we handle them, how we perceive them and how we react to them will always have an impact on how we feel about the outcome. That is where we do have some control.

I hope your day has been a good one, and I hope you have made time to follow your heart too. Whether you are at work, at home, caring for a sick relative or child, find time to go with the flow of life…look out for the rainbows.

With love and gratitude on this, calm, yet rainy day ☺
