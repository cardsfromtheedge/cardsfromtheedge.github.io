It was with trepidation that I set out to write this next blog post… even though I knew what lay ahead, I had no idea how I would feel over the coming weeks following the major shift mentioned in the last blog. I cannot help but smile as I recall the song “Life is a Rollercoaster” by Ronan Keating. Life really does seem to be a rollercoaster at the moment. Every time I think I’ve got something sorted something else comes along and shakes it all up again. *How has life been for you recently?*

I have found myself getting a bit bogged down with world events recently, and although I choose not to watch the news on TV, I do dip into the news online.  I do not want to bury my head in the sand, nor do I want to get sucked into the fear that seems to permeate the mainstream media style of reporting. However, I do feel a need to know what is happening to our beautiful world. I then have to take a deep breath and remind myself to keep being kind and to remember that these wee ripples of kindness are my way of making a difference in the world (albeit a small one).  We all have our part to play and no part is too small. When I feel that I make no difference I remember the analogy of the midge and it’s tiny bite! 

It is with this in mind, that I remember how difficult it is to be kind sometimes, especially when your emotions get in the way. I feel that we are generally wired for kindness, and certainly it helps our own wellbeing when we are kind to others. To me, it feels so natural to be kind whenever you have the opportunity. Whether it’s picking up someone else’s litter from the ground, doing a days volunteering, supporting a small business, or doing the washing up for someone else. But, how often are you really kind to yourself?

By this, I don’t mean eating some cake, taking a long soak in the bath or some other thing, many of us, may term a lovely indulgence. I mean, talking to yourself in a kind way, stop for a moment and listen to your own internal dialogue at the minute. What are you saying to yourself?  Are you telling yourself how well you are doing, how far you have come, how kind you were to someone the other day OR are you saying things like - I should be this or that, I’m not good enough, I am too fat, too thin, I should be doing some paperwork or something else??  Just for a minute, think or say some kind things to yourself ☺ and see how you feel afterwards. 

That’s one of the things I do when I’m feeling bogged down with life. I’ve learnt over the years that we can be our own worst enemy sometimes.  If we seek peace in our mind (and what better way to seek than through kindness), we will spread peace out into the world. If we spread peace out into the world with kindness, than little by little we will make a difference. Never for one moment think that you are not able to make a difference. When I think like that, I do someone or something a kindness. Then I know that however small the action, I have the power to make a difference.  Sending you kind thoughts with gratitude. ☺
