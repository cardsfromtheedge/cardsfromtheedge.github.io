I love it when I have time to reflect and plan ahead, I’m coming to the conclusion that the New Year starts for me at the beginning of February! Maybe, that’s why I’ve never bothered with New Year Resolutions, they always seemed a waste of time, it feels like setting myself up to fail before the year has even got started.

January was a month of quiet hibernation and keeping warm. That doesn’t mean I’ve not been out at all, but it does mean I’ve not set any real goals and have floated along on the tide of life for a few weeks.  It feels good acknowledging that. It takes the quiet moments to realize yet again, that I’m doing OK just as I am. It feels good to let go of thoughts of what others may be doing or have done, it feels liberating to stop and stare at the sky once in a while.  When everything else in the world seems so uncertain, looking up into the night sky at the stars and the moon is a real tonic, or looking across a mist filled valley on a crisp winters day, will always help put things into perspective.

*What do you do to get things back into perspective?* I maintain my daily practice of 3 things I’m grateful for, replaying them in my mind as my head settles into my pillow each night, and no matter how good or bad the day might have appeared, believe me, there is always something to grateful for. As I mention in my book ‘Cards from the Edge’ often it’s as simple as the air that we breathe or the chair that we’re sat upon. 

I’ve come back to this practice many times over the last 4 years since my sister’s death. It’s been a real struggle some days, but it helps focus the mind and gets you moving mentally at a time when you could so easily become stuck. My sister is along side me in so many ways. She is a constant reminder to live from the heart and to acknowledge what makes your heart sing. Not, because these things came easily to her, but because they didn’t.

She was an expert at other people’s happiness, always encouraging their light to shine. It is one of the over riding memories I took away with me the other weekend, when I re-read the many messages from friends and family in the memory books created at her funeral/celebration of life service, and shortly afterwards at the wonderful memorial service held for her. It’s something I’m often compelled to do as well, but it is this memory of her that now helps me to shine again. As her light in some ways shines brighter than ever for me, it reminds me to move forward from the darkness, with happiness as one of my goals.  So with gratitude tucked firmly under my belt, and a realization that we do indeed always have a choice, I might just start setting some more goals again! ☺
