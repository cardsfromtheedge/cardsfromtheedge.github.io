I’d only just finished writing and there it was again, that wonderful feeling of peacefulness sweeping over me ☺ what had caused it? I asked myself. Looking down I saw hands in Marigolds (washing up gloves!!) and lots of bubbles.  How can washing up make me happy, I hear you ask! Well, it’s the act of being exactly where you want to be, doing exactly what you feel like doing in the exact moment you’ve chosen to do it – while waiting for the kettle to boil ☺ Simple, so very simple.

Yet, it has had a much deeper affect on me. It’s reminded me, that often we gain the greatest pleasures from the simplest of actions. It’s a wet day outside and I could have forced myself out a bit earlier, but that wasn’t what I felt like doing, instead I’ve gone with the flow and now I feel contented and yet again that inner peacefulness sweeps over me.  I will get wrapped up and go out shortly, but for now the mug of tea is waiting patiently for me and my hands are gliding over the keyboard (always a favourite occupation these days).

When we go with the flow of life and not against it, we reap the benefits in so many ways.  Sometimes, I acknowledge that we have to do things that we’d rather not. At those times, just remember to do it with love and remember that there is a reason it probably has to be done. _What do you need to do that you’ve been putting off?_ Put a smile on your face and some music on while doing the chore, add joy to your actions and then, maybe you’ll feel joy added to you! ☺

There have been many dark days on The Edge over the last few years. Every time I feel a shadow over me, I allow that feeling to say hello, I acknowledge it, so it knows I feel it fully and then I remind myself to move on. I try a smile (even a forced one is better than a frown and it takes less muscles too, ah I remember my sister and what we called her Cheshire cat smile) then I add a sprinkling of _Joy_ - whether it be uplifting music, beautiful or inspiring pictures or a look outside the door, and before you know it she’ll come bounding back in various ways – Joy has that knack of creeping in and keeping you company in the simplest of things. In the early days it wasn’t very often, but as time moved on, Joy returned again and again, _always_ remember to let her in ☺

I like to play on words and Joy to me has always been ‘Jo-Why?’ And at this moment I smile and say well why not! And why not indeed, we all deserve happiness and peacefulness in our lives. It’s up to _you_ to invite Joy in, she may not stay long to start with, but she’ll always return if you ask her to visit again. We always have a choice, and I try to choose Joy over pain always. (I’ve learnt the hard way! I hope you won’t have to) Now, it’s time to get outside and breathe deeply. Thank you for reading. Just a thought - _Do you need to get outside too? Off you go then!_ With gratitude ☺
