After a quiet few days catching up with things at home. We were packing up again to head south for a couple of days. This time for a dear friends big-0 birthday party. 

It felt a great effort driving for 7-8 hours to get there, but the rewards were immense on so many levels. 

Nothing can beat spending time with friends that you’ve known a long time, where the months apart fall away, and you pick up where you left off. You laugh, compare notes, exchange new ideas and fill in any gaps; you share a meal and cherish a cup of tea or a glass of something stronger! ☺  

When I’m back on the Edge looking out to sea, as by now you’ll know I often do, I cannot help, but marvel at how many wonderful people I’ve met in my life. 

Some come and stay, and some go. All connections are there for a reason, and distance may keep us apart for much of the time, but in an instant this does not matter.

The present moment becomes everything.

How easy it is to be in the present moment when you are having fun and there’s lots going on right in front of you, and all around you!

In my pursuit of peaceful, contented living here on the Edge, there have been several times of acceptance, that letting go is the best and only course of action. Sometimes, it has been easy and other times incredibly difficult.

However, letting go is a call for freedom, an inner knowing.

Letting go of people, letting go of places, letting go of the best laid plans and letting go of loved ones as they pass away.

As I let go of one set of friends and moved on to another over this wonderful weekend, I felt full of emotion about our time living in the beautiful Yorkshire Dales. The ease at which we could easily reach different places and different people, and yet deep within I was gently reminded there is no sea!

Some may say everything has it’s price, and to a certain extent that is true.

Again sat looking out to sea, I cherish the time spent away (as I always do) but my heart is here in the rugged beauty of the Highlands. 

Something runs deep, something within my soul knows.

There’s always a moment of truth a day or two after the excitement has worn off and you’re again faced with the reality of day-to-day life. It’s been said before, but you have a choice. 

Choose wisely!

Today, after a rather vexing telephone conversation the choice was get upset and angry, or get outside and go for a walk along the beach to get the air in our lungs. Always an ideal opportunity to put things into perspective, and it worked!

The first half of the walk was a passionate verbal onslaught about all the things wrong in the world, and how could I make even a small difference when it all seems so overwhelming.

However, the second half, which by the way, included great endeavour to find some shelter from the blustery wind, to allow a 10 minute sit on the rocks, while trying to look out to sea, as the rain came horizontally onshore, for which we were ill prepared! 

Then the sun graced us with her company, just at the point when I was calming down, finding something to laugh about, and deciding it was time to head back home.

The walk back was bracing, but beautiful, and the energy had shifted into an altogether better place.

Thank you Universe.

It paved the way for more writing and the wonderful feeling of being back in the flow again. In the words of Gabrielle Bernstein “The Universe has your back” and indeed it does ☺ Feeling grateful as the darkness descends on another wild and wintry day on the Edge. 

With love to you all, as you let go of things that no longer serve you ☺
