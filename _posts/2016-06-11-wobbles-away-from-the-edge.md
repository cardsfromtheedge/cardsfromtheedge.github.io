It would be easy to only write about the good times in life, but the more I write, the more I realize you have 
to embrace your dark side too. I have steered away from my own dark side as often as possible in the past few 
years and put a lot of effort into being a happy, cheerful person. One of my mantras being - *I choose Happy* :smile:  
Well, sometimes I have to confess that happy may be the preferred choice, but the darkness descends and 
I hear my inner voice telling me to pull out all the stops to cheer up. I am learning that pushing this 
darkness away makes it persist, generally it goes much quicker if you allow it to be. You don’t exactly 
need to welcome it, but you do need to embrace it and remind yourself it will pass.

However, a couple of days ago, while sat in a cold apartment as we’d run out of oil and a delivery was 2 
days away. I felt darkness creeping into me, like an insidious cold taking hold and finding every weakness 
within me. I counted my blessings and reminded myself how lucky I am, I tried to focus on the good and 
steer away from the not so good. I went out into nature and enjoyed the mountain views, but what I didn’t 
do was really acknowledge those feelings and embrace them and of course, totally forgot to tell myself it 
will pass! 

Instead I bereted myself silently, wondering would I ever feel happy again. My mind was telling me I always 
felt like this and it would never end, I told myself that all the hard work I had put into choosing happy 
obviously hadn’t worked and I was literally doomed to suffer! Funnily enough, writing this now a few days 
later, I am totally bemused at my own self-created drama. The difference is now it has passed and I can 
see how easily we can spiral downwards, I know I need to be a bit more mindful in the future. *Has this 
ever happened to you?*

In fact, the cloud lifted as quickly as it came, but in the middle of it all, it seemed forever.  I’ve 
become an expert at appearing happy to the majority of the world, who remembers the saying - *“cry and 
you cry alone, smile and the world smiles with you”?*  Well for me, this rings so true. I have always tried 
to hide my tears and mainly keep the smiles for the public eye. What I have discovered over the last few 
years is that, it is energy quenching work! I am beginning to appreciate, that it’s OK to show your 
vulnerability sometimes, and in doing so, thing’s really do seem to shift. For me, I will continue to choose 
happy, but I will give myself permission to let my guard down every now and then. It takes less energy and 
the sadness seems to pass quicker. 

On reflection, I would say giving yourself permission to feel however you feel, is good self-care. What is 
not good self-care is to allow the sadness to take hold and start to eat away at you. That’s when, getting 
out in nature is such a great natural remedy and counting your blessings however small they may seem can 
really help. So for now, the sunshine has returned in my heart and when the darkness descends again, I’ll 
remind myself of this blog and hopefully I’ll be grateful for my own musings :smile:  As always with gratitude and 
remember the sun always shines behind the clouds however dark they may appear…… and will return to warm you
once again.
