                <h2>About the book</h2>
                <p>Cards from the Edge will take you on a short journey of creativity and love from one friend to another by way of full STOPs and smileys! They were written during a short spell in a lifetime of magical moments, often lit by candles and always followed by our friend the moon. Be uplifted and inspired to create.</p>
                <p>Published to raise funds for the Highland Hospice's Â£4.5 million Project Build Appeal for their new in-patient unit, Inverness. In memory of Jenny Turner, who was wonderfully cared for by everyone at the Hospice and who inspired the author to re-discover her own creativity.</p>
